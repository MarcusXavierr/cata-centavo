/**
 * A credit card statement as we speak of it. Money in integer cents; dates as
 * `YYYY-MM-DD` taken from the payload's UTC parts, because the connectors send
 * a calendar date wearing a time — `00:00:00.000Z` on the real one and
 * `03:00:00.000Z` on the sandbox — and in UTC−3 the second parses to the
 * previous day (ADR §14.3).
 *
 * Charges and payments are summed at the boundary rather than passed through.
 * ADR §16.2 records an unbounded nested array dominating a response; these are
 * the same shape.
